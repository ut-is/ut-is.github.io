Information systems have become the foundation of social life in recent years, and the social impact of system failures, such as the system downtime at the stock exchange, is enormous. On the other hand, it is said that there will be a shortage of approximately 430,000 IT personnel by 2025, making it an imperative to ensure both reliability and functionality with ever more limited development resources. One way to solve this problem is to automate a part of software development, one of the intellectual production activities, and to create an environment in which developers can allocate their limited time to creative work. The speaker has been conducting research in the field of mining software repositories, which model software quality by analyzing large software development data. In this talk, I will first give an overview of the mining software repository, and then introduce some of my research results on (1) refactoring, (2) bug prediction, and (3) program modification as specific topics that I have been working on. Finally, directions and prospects of software engineering will be presented.
